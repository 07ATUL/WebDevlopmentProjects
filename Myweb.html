	<p>Hello I am <a href="Earlylife.html"> Atul Kumar</a> a BE-ECE Student who is in love with problem solving and <a href="https://github.com/07ATUL">building stuff</a> this is also a part of project which i am working on and developing to revise the concepts which i knew since 1st year.
	</p></li>

<li>
	<p>People say Engineering is hard i believe that it depends on the depth your are willing to go to understand it , if you want to go deeper and look into how things work then yes sometimes it can be tiring, but if you have the passion and curosity for getting things done surely you can do great.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>Who is an Engineer?, Well the answer is quite Simply Complex. A Person who solves the problem with given resources and makes use of the exsisting knowledge to create what is called a solution of a particular problem , do you know what is the best part ? , The problem solving is fun because a lot of people are working day and night as a community to help and make the world a better place to live and achieve more.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>People make fun of Engineers in India Saying they are useless, Everyone in India is an Engineer or A Dog? , Well i want to say that it is upto you it is your own decision which decides what you want to become, it is your life and you have to take responsibility for it and if you learn the skills required put in the hard work you will surely do wonders.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>Always remember the rules of management because two things go hand in hand while in engineering one is Science and the other is Management, to get great results you have to work in a team and the team work is dependent on team will as each of us are unique so is the other person so having to match
	our frequency with a group of people is a tough task to master.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>Well making projects is a fun way to learn a new technology.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Project based learning approach lets you to be creative and experiment so that you get the indepth knowledge about a technology knowing about the key details and working on them, I think we should try to create an environment for overall learning and development because in the end you have to work in a team and building things with your friends is always cool.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>I think there are plenty of online resources available to get you started in you development carrier but all that takes is a willpower to make something. We all think that when we start something we should see some immediate results but in actual practice it takes a lot of time to build stuff. The reason being that we all have just a slight knowledge of the technologies being used when we go into building stuff we have to get inside the computer to know how do things work to get a better understanding of the project we are working on. I believe that all the advice on internet which says you have to practice a particular technology is mostly correct because we have to give ourselves some time to get to know indepth analysis.</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>During the time of Coronavirus Crisis i am writing this paragraph all i can do is to pray daily and keep working on my projects to enhance my learning abilities, i want to be a great problem solver because in the time of worldwide crisis all we know that it could be solved if you have some extraordinary problem solving skills, the reason being that the only cure of coronavirus being if a vaccine is developed very fast and made into production such that all the patients in the world be cured at a fast rate and to make a vaccine you need to run various algorithmic test on sequences and to do so you need a great computing power, supercomputers are harnessed for their power of computing and to operate them you must have some strong problem solving abilities.</p></li>
