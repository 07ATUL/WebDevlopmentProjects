	<p>Hello I am <a href="Earlylife.html"> Atul Kumar</a> a BE-ECE Student whos is in love with problem solving and <a href="https://github.com/07ATUL">building stuff</a> this is also a part of project which i am working on and developing to revise the concepts which i knew since 1st year.

	<p>People say Engineering is hard i believe that it depends on the depth your are willing to go to understand it , if you want to go deeper and look into how things work then yes sometimes it can be tiring, but if you have the passion and curosity for getting things done surely you can do great.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>Who is an Engineer?, Well the answer is quite Simply Complex. A Person who solves the problem with given resources and makes use of the exsisting knowledge to create what is called a solution of a particular problem , do you know what is the best part ? , The problem solving is fun because a lot of people are working day and night as a community to help and make the world a better place to live and achieve more.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>People make fun of Engineers in India Saying they are useless, Everyone in India is an Engineer or A Dog? , Well i want to say that it is upto you it is your own decision which decides what you want to become, it is your life and you have to take responsibility for it and if you learn the skills required put in the hard work you will surely do wonders.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p>Always remember the rules of management because two things go hand in hand while in engineering one is Science and the other is Management, to get great results you have to work in a team and the team work is dependent on team will as each of us are unique so is the other person so having to match 
	our frequency with a group of people is a tough task to master.</p></li>
