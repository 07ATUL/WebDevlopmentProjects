<li><p>In these difficult times we could do nothing but stay at home and pray for the pandemic to get over we can and should avoid social distancing as much as possible.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We all who are in India can contribute to the Prime Minister Relief Fund by simply initating a google search for the same.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The main thing we need to remeber is that it is always a joint effort of various bodies when a country wins over the fight over a worldwide pandemic we should always try to avoid politics as much as we can over the matter so that we are reinitiating the fact that we all are human beings</p></li>
<li>
<p>What is the benefit of being a human if you cannot even help a human being in this crisis and how are we going to justify our wrong doings , As a social creature it is our duty to help all the human beings and animals as much as possible</p></li>
<li>
<p>The government of India announced the a nationwide lockdown for 21 days so that our countrymen remain at home safe with their parents while some of our soldiers, when i say soldiers i mean all the policemen, soldiers, doctors, paramedics all those people who are risking their life so that the country lives, once the pandemic is over we must thank them with all respect and honour them. If any of us thinks what we can do to help them then there is a way in which they can be helped which is by buying and giving them what they call is a PPE which stands for a Personal Protective Equipment which will be a great help to them so that they are themselves safe. Dear all in this crisis it is the need of the hour to save our doctors because they are those who will help our nation in recovering the people who are infected with the virus.
