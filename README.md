# WebDevelopmentProjects
It contains projects which can be used to learn web development with html and css.
You can focus on step by step approach and use freecodecamp and w3schools as a resource to learn and try to experiment different things as true engineering lies in solving problems and can be only done if you are keen to learn, have the curosity and want to experiment.
The main motive for the web development is to bring out your creativity and help out someone with the technology as much as you can and the best thing about this is that you can test your changes live without waiting for the complete project.
Happy Coding!
